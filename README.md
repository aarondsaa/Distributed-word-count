# Distributed-Word-Count-Lab 3
The Distributed Word Count Lab is a hands-on exercise designed to introduce the concepts of distributed computing and parallel processing using Python. In this lab, participants build a simple distributed system that splits a text-processing task across multiple worker processes. The system consists of a coordinator script (`coordinator.py`) and one or more worker scripts (`worker.py`), which communicate via sockets. The coordinator divides a text into chunks, distributes each chunk to a worker, and aggregates the word counts returned by the workers. Each worker listens for incoming text chunks, counts the words in the chunk, and sends the results back to the coordinator. The lab demonstrates basic socket programming, process management, and result aggregation using Python's `collections.Counter`.

Participants start by running multiple worker processes, each listening on a specific port. The coordinator then sends text chunks to these workers and collects the partial word counts. The final aggregated word counts are displayed by the coordinator. The lab also includes a mechanism for gracefully shutting down the workers by sending a "DONE" signal. This mini-MapReduce-style project provides a practical introduction to distributed systems, emphasizing task division, parallel execution, and result combination. It is suitable for learners with basic Python knowledge and an interest in distributed computing. The lab encourages experimentation, such as adding more workers, handling failures, and load balancing. By completing this lab, participants gain foundational skills in building distributed systems and processing data in parallel.
